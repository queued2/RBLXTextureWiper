# RBLXTextureWiper
A free and open-source batch script for Windows that helps manage textures on Roblox bootstrappers (Fishstrap, Bloxstrap, Voidstrap, Lunastrap, blah blah blah).

* Supports archiving textures in zip files
* Supports detailed logs on what it is deleting
* Good for managing your textures between Roblox bootstrappers
* Good for debloating or cutting-down on textures after the FFlag Patch ([https://devforum.roblox.com/t/allowlist-for-local-client-configuration-via-fast-flags/3966569](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/allowlist-for-local-client-configuration-via-fast-flags/3966569))
* Very lightweight (4kb), supports most popular GUI bootstrappers as of right now


## Proof it works (no stud textures on baseplate game)
